We are all aware of Mark Zuckerberg's testimony to congress, made in April 2018.

We all like to judge him because the data his platform collected was given to unauthorized sources without our knowledge.

Yet, most of us still keep active Facebook profiles. It's hard to stay away out of the world's most popular social network.

But the problem with the data might not be Zuckerberg's fault. Actually, not entirely.

You see, we all put data on our Facebook profiles. Statuses about our opinions, shares of that comedic video we saw last week or the breakfast we had in that vacation that was WAY overpriced.

Each and every piece of information we put in that little "What's on your mind?" box is sent to their servers, to their advertises, to Mark.

And as much as people like to say that they know that, and that they are the product, they still complain about having their data used for ads.

So I thought of a simple solution that will pass the message clear.

Introducing ***FaceZUCC*** *by Idoideas*, a Chrome extension that turns each of your friends & pages in your Facebook window into Mark Zuckerberg's profile.
